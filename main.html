    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational time required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It is a crucial measure for determining how efficient an algorithm is, particularly in terms of execution speed. A more efficient algorithm takes less time to complete tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm needs to run, based on the size of the input. It helps evaluate how much additional space the algorithm requires. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</b>
