	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>In coding, Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows. It's a way to measure the efficiency of an algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that can handle large inputs in a reasonable amount of time, often with a time complexity that's as low as possible. For instance, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) is generally more efficient than one with O(n^2) because it scales better as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms are crucial for solving problems within practical time limits, especially as data sets become larger.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.</b></p>
